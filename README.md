This repo stores files related to my final project for DTSA 5509 Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning.

The topic of this final will be to explore various supervised learning techniques and compare their performances in accurately recognizing various images. The dataset contains various images of roadways veering left and right. The goal is to predict a continuous value that reflects desired steering angle via regression models. These models will be of the following variety:
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- SVM
